Diagnostic Problem 1:

Joseph and Jane are making a contest for apes. During the process, they have to communicate
frequently with each other. Since they are not completely human, they cannot speak properly.
They have to transfer messages using postcards of small sizes.
To save space on the small postcards, they devise a string compression algorithm:
  ● If a character occurs n times in a row, then it will be represented by {char}{n} where {n} is
  the value of occurrence. For example, if the substring is a sequence of 'a' ("aaaa"), it will
  be represented as "a4".
  ● If a character occurs exactly one time in a row, then it will be simply represented as the
  character itself. For example, if the substring is "a", then it will be represented as "a".
  Help Joseph to compress a message, msg.
Input
The only line of input contains a string, msg.
Output
Print the string msg as a compressed message

My Answer:

def compress_message(msg):
    compressed_msg = ""
    count = 1

    for i in range(1, len(msg)):
        if msg[i] == msg[i - 1]:
            count += 1
        else:
            compressed_msg += msg[i - 1] + str(count) if count > 1 else msg[i - 1]
            count = 1

    compressed_msg += msg[-1] + str(count) if count > 1 else msg[-1]
    return compressed_msg

##Input
msg = input().strip()

##Output
compressed_message = compress_message(msg)
print(compressed_message)
