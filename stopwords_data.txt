New York Institute of Technology is located near the columbus circle which is located on the 1855 Broadway but my class is located on the 16w 61st street ,
I always take the subway from World trade center to the 59th street ,
I love the gelato in the Venchi and if at all I get hungry after my class I go to the Amor pizza cafe which is located on 370w 58th street
,Totally love their Pizza !
